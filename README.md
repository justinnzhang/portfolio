# My Portfolio Website
https://justinzhang.ca

This project started out as pure HTML & CSS site in 2018. Since then, I've been able to start experimenting with React, Gatsby, and more!

I will be updating the site as I go, learning new techniques to refine the code base. Feel free to clone the repo and play around if you want :)
