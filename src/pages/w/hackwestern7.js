            With the pandemic pushing everything online, we had to quickly adapt
            our event and create Hack Western's first ever online event. Through
            creating new engagement measures such as activity tracking through
            Zoom webhooks, to developing a fully functional online platform, we
            saw the <strong>highest level of engagement ever</strong> and had
            the <strong>most project submissions ever</strong> in the 7 year
            history of Hack Western.
